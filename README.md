## Sentiment Analysis/Classifier and Flask Deployment

This project uses an open source data set of Airline tweets. The data set has the tweet already classified into positive, neutral, and negative along with the confidence level for each classification. 

In the example here I set up a simple NLP sentiment analysis example, cleaning the data and running the classification through a random forest. The code is then modified to allow for scoring one text input. 

Finally a chunk of code uses Flask to deploy the model and provide real time sentiment analysis of input text.
